Title: wordpress now on own infra
Date: 2019-08-26
Category: Infrastructure, Update

We have a copy running under a seperate subdomain for testing.

The next goal in the international level infrastructure push is to move mail services to something with [2fa](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication). 
fastmail and g suite seem to be up to the job.
